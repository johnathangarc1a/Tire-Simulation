# Tire-Simulation
Simulation of wear and tear effects on racecar tires (given limited info regarding tires)
While I was a member of USF FSAE (Formula Society of Automotive Engineers), I was in the Data Acquisition subgroup. Our primary focus was to provide data to our mechanical/electrical engineering subgroups that could support design choices. I was tasked with simulating tire performance under varying conditions. This is a short MatLab script describing tire performance.
